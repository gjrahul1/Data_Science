## Introduction

Email spam is a significant problem that affects users worldwide. This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam. The notebook includes steps for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a collection of emails labeled as spam or ham (not spam). The dataset is preprocessed to clean the text data and extract features for model training.

## Dependencies

To run the notebook, you need the following libraries:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gjrahul1/Spam_Email_Prediction.git
cd Spam_Email_Prediction
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Spam_Email_Prediction.ipynb
```

4. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Results

The notebook includes visualizations and metrics to evaluate the model's performance. Key results include:

- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
- ROC Curve
- Accuracy Score
