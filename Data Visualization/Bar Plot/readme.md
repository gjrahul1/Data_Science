### What are bar plots?
- A bar chart is a chart or graph that represents numerical measures (such as counts, means, etc.) broken out by a categorical variable.
- It does this by using rectangular bars with heights (or lengths) that are proportional to different values.
- You would generally use a barplot when you have at least one categorical variable and one numeric variable.
- Barplots are used to display the differences (and similarities) between the categories.

- By default, Seaborn will calculate the mean (the “average”) of a value, split into different categories.
- Let’s take a look at what a bar plot looks like and what we can expect to learn from it.
  
- Seaborn also includes an error bar, which represents the 95% confidence interval that new data would fall into that range
