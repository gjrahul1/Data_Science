### Chi Sqaure Test
- Pearson’s Chi-Square Test is a fundamental statistical method used to evaluate the relationship between categorical variables.
- By comparing observed frequencies with expected frequencies, this test determines whether significant differences exist within data.
- Understanding how to perform a “chi2 test python” or “python chi square test” is essential for effective data analysis.

#### What is Pearson’s Chi-Square Test?
Pearson’s Chi-Square Test is a fundamental statistical method that evaluates whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables.
It tests the null hypothesis that the variables are independent.

#### Key Concepts:
Observed Frequencies: The actual count of occurrences in each category, which can be analyzed using tools such as “chisquare python.”

Expected Frequencies: The counts expected if the null hypothesis is true, allowing researchers to understand the distribution of data better.

Chi-Square Statistic: A measure of how much the observed frequencies deviate from the expected frequencies, commonly calculated in Python using the “chi2 test python.”

P-value: Indicates the probability of observing the data assuming the null hypothesis is true, helping to determine the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis.

Null Hypothesis : A null Hypothesis is a general statistical statement or assumption about a population parameter that is assumed to be true Until we have sufficient evidence to reject it. It is generally denoted by Ho.

Alternate Hypothesis : The Alternate Hypothesis is considered as competing of the null hypothesis. It is generally denoted by H1 . The general goal of our hypothesis testing is to test the Alternative hypothesis against the null hypothesis.
