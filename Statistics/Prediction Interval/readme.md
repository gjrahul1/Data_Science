### Prediction Interval

A prediction interval is a quantiﬁcation of the uncertainty on a prediction.

It provides a probabilistic upper and lower bounds on the estimate of an outcome variable.

Prediction intervals are most commonly used when making predictions or forecasts with a regression model, where a quantity is being predicted. 

An example of the presentation of a prediction interval is as follows:

Given a prediction of ‘y’ given ‘x’, there is a 95% likelihood that the range ‘a’ to ‘b’ covers the true outcome.

The prediction interval surrounds the prediction made by the model and hopefully covers the range of the true outcome. The diagram below helps to visually understand the relationship between the prediction, prediction interval, and the actual outcome.
