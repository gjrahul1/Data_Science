**Standard Deviation:**

Standard deviation is a measure of how spread out the numbers in a data set are. 

In simpler terms, it tells us how much the individual data points differ from the mean (average) of the data.

A low standard deviation means that most of the data points are close to the mean, while a high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a wide range of values.

Example:

Imagine you have the following test scores:

- [
85
,
86
,
88
,
89
,
90
]

The mean (average) is 87.6. Because the scores are close to this mean, the standard deviation will be low.

Now consider:


- [
60
,
70
,
80
,
90
,
100
]


Even though the mean might be the same, the standard deviation will be higher because the scores are more spread out.

- In a normal distribution, nearly all (99.7%) of the data points fall within three standard deviations of the mean.
  
- If a data point lies outside this range, it may be considered an outlier.

  ### How calculation is done ?

  - ±1σ: Mean ± 1σ = 66 ± 3 = [63, 69]

  - ±2σ: Mean ± 2σ = 66 ± 2(3) = [60, 72]

  - ±3σ: Mean ± 3σ = 66 ± 3(3) = [57, 75]
